        <h2>Allow me to introduce myself. </h2>
        <br>
        <p>I am Jiyoung Lee, and I work as a flight attendant at Scandinavian Airlines. 
           <br>I've been in this role for about a year. 
           <br>My base is London Heathrow Airport, and I've been in London for a year and five months. 
           <br>Prior to that, I was born and raised in Korea. The reason I came to London was 
           <br>first, to improve my English skills 
           <br>and second, to grow as a person by experiencing a completely different culture. 
           <br>Currently I am very satisfied with my life and enjoy each day to the fullest.</p>
           <br>
           <br>

           <h2>Why I would like to move into a career 
            <br>as a web developer.</h2>
           <br>
           <p>The reason I want to transition from being a flight attendant to a developer is multifaceted. 
            <br>Firstly, I have a strong interest in technology and programming, 
            <br>and I aim to gain more knowledge and experience in this field. 
            <br>Secondly, working as a developer provides opportunities to solve challenging problems and think creatively, 
            <br>which I believe will enhance my intellectual abilities. 
            <br>Lastly, transitioning to a developer role is seen as an opportunity for both personal and professional growth, 
            <br>aligning with my long-term career goals and offering a continuous path for improving my skills.</p>
